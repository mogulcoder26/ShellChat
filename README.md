This code is an example of creating a TCP server using Node.js's built-in net module. The server listens for incoming connections on port 3099 of the local host (127.0.0.1).

The first line const net = require("net"); imports the net module, which provides functionality for creating TCP servers and clients.

The net.createServer() method is used to create an instance of a TCP server. The method takes a callback function as its argument, which will be executed whenever a new connection is established with the server.

Inside the callback function (socket) => { ... }, the socket object represents the duplex stream for communication between the server and the client. The server listens for the 'data' event on the socket, indicating that data has been received from the client.

When the 'data' event is triggered, the callback function (data) => { ... } is executed. The received data is a buffer, so data.toString("utf-8") is used to convert it to a readable string in UTF-8 encoding. The converted data is then logged to the console.

Finally, the server.listen() method is called to start the server. It takes three arguments: the port to listen on (3099), the host IP address (in this case, "127.0.0.1" refers to the local host), and a callback function that is executed once the server is successfully listening. The callback function logs the address on which the server is listening.

So, when you run this code, it creates a TCP server that listens on port 3099 of the local host. When a client connects and sends data, the server will log the received data to the console.

> WHAT IS THE "DATA" EVENT 

In Node.js, the 'data' event is emitted by a net.Socket object when data is received from the other end of the socket. It indicates that there is incoming data available to be read.

socket.on('data', (data) => { ... }) sets up an event listener for the 'data' event on the socket object. When the event is triggered, the callback function (data) => { ... } is executed, and the received data is passed as an argument.The 'data' event allows you to handle incoming data from clients in a streaming fashion. As data is received, the event is emitted, and you can perform operations on the received data, such as processing, logging, or sending a response back to the client.

> Note that the 'data' event may be emitted multiple times, depending on the amount of data received. It's common to handle the data event by appending the received chunks of data until you have received a complete message or have reached the desired data length.

Overall, the 'data' event is a crucial part of TCP socket programming as it allows you to react to incoming data and perform appropriate actions based on the received information.

> WHAT IS TCP ? 

Imagine you and your friend want to play a game and talk to each other using toy walkie-talkies. TCP is like a special set of rules that you and your friend follow to make sure your messages reach each other correctly.

Here's how TCP works:

- You and your friend agree on a secret language or code that you'll use to talk. This is like choosing a specific way to understand each other's messages.

- Before you start talking, you make sure that you're both ready. You say, "Are you ready?" and your friend says, "Yes, I'm ready!" This is like checking if you're both listening and paying attention.

- Now, when you want to send a message, you say it slowly and clearly. You break it down into small parts, like saying one word at a time. After saying each word, you wait for your friend to say, "Got it!" before saying the next word. This way, your friend can understand each word properly.

- Once you finish saying all the words, your friend repeats them back to you to make sure they got the message right. This is like your friend checking if they understood all the words correctly.

- If your friend missed a word or didn't understand something, they tell you, and you say that word again. You keep doing this until your friend gets all the words right. This makes sure that the message is complete and accurate.

That's how TCP works! It's like following special rules to talk to each other and make sure your messages are delivered correctly. It helps you and your friend have a smooth and reliable conversation, just like playing a game using walkie-talkies with a secret code.

> Wat is UDP ? 

UDP is like sending messages with a magic teleporting ball. Here's how UDP works:

Imagine you and your friend are playing a game in a big park. You want to send messages to each other, but you don't have walkie-talkies or phones.

Instead, you find a magical teleporting ball. When you throw the ball, it instantly appears in your friend's hands, no matter how far away they are. This is like sending a message with UDP.

- You write your message on a piece of paper, put it inside the ball, and throw it to your friend. The ball teleports to your friend in an instant, and they catch it.

- Your friend opens the ball, reads the message, and throws the ball back to you with their own message inside. Again, the ball teleports to you right away.

- Both of you can keep throwing the ball back and forth, sending messages to each other. It's quick and simple!

However, there's something to keep in mind:

> Sometimes, the ball can get lost in the park. If it happens, you won't know if your friend received your message or not. That's because UDP doesn't have a way to guarantee that the ball will always reach its destination.

> Also, if the park is crowded and many people are throwing balls, they might get mixed up, and you won't know which ball came from your friend. That's because UDP doesn't keep track of the order of messages.

So, UDP is like a fun and fast way to send messages using teleporting balls, but you have to accept that sometimes messages can get lost, and they may not arrive in the same order they were sent.


> Real life applications to TCP :

- Web Browsing: When you open a web browser and visit a website, TCP is used to establish a connection between your device and the web server hosting the website. TCP ensures that the website data, such as text, images, and videos, is reliably transmitted from the server to your device. It guarantees the correct ordering of data packets, retransmits lost packets if needed, and ensures the integrity of the data.

- Email Communication: When you send or receive emails, TCP is used to establish connections between your email client (e.g., Outlook, Gmail) and the email server. TCP ensures that your email messages are delivered reliably and in the correct order. It handles the transmission of email data across networks, even if the network conditions are not perfect.

- File Transfer: When you download files from the internet or transfer files between devices on a local network, TCP is commonly used. TCP ensures that the file is transferred without errors, by dividing it into small packets and reassembling them correctly on the receiving end. This is important for large file transfers, where every bit of data needs to be correct.

- Remote Desktop: When you use remote desktop software to access another computer or server remotely, TCP is used to establish a secure and reliable connection. TCP ensures that the actions you perform on your local computer are accurately transmitted to the remote computer and vice versa. It provides a smooth experience, allowing you to control the remote computer as if you were physically present.

- Online Gaming: TCP is often used for online gaming where real-time interaction between players is required. TCP guarantees that game commands and updates are transmitted reliably, ensuring that the game state remains synchronized across all players. Although TCP adds some latency compared to UDP, its reliability is preferred in gaming scenarios to avoid data loss and maintain consistency.

> Real life applications to UDP :

- Video Streaming: UDP is frequently used for live video streaming, such as video conferences, online video chats, and streaming platforms like YouTube or Twitch. UDP's low latency and reduced overhead make it suitable for real-time applications where a small delay is acceptable, and a few lost packets won't significantly impact the viewing experience. If a few video frames are lost, the stream can continue without waiting for retransmission.

- Voice over IP (VoIP): UDP is widely used in Voice over IP applications like Skype, WhatsApp, or Zoom. These applications require real-time communication, and UDP's low latency and quick delivery are advantageous. Voice data packets are transmitted rapidly, and even if some packets are lost, it's more important to maintain the conversation's flow than to ensure every packet arrives.

- DNS (Domain Name System): When you type a website URL into your browser, the DNS system resolves the URL into an IP address. DNS queries and responses use UDP. DNS requests are generally small and require quick responses, so UDP's lightweight nature and faster transmission suit this purpose.

- IoT (Internet of Things) Applications: UDP is often used in IoT devices that require low power consumption and efficient communication. For example, smart home devices like light bulbs or temperature sensors may use UDP to send updates to a central hub or server. These updates are typically small and can be transmitted quickly without the need for TCP's reliability mechanisms.

- Online Multiplayer Games: UDP is commonly used in online multiplayer games where real-time interaction and low latency are crucial. Games like Fortnite or Minecraft use UDP for faster transmission of game commands, player positions, and updates. While some packets may be lost, the focus is on maintaining real-time responsiveness rather than retransmitting every lost packet.

- In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint that allows different applications or processes on a computer to send and receive data over a network. Ports are identified by numbers and are used to distinguish between different network services running on a single device.

> What is a Port ? 

A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer, ranging from 0 to 65535. Port numbers from 0 to 1023 are well-known or privileged ports, reserved for specific services like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 21), etc. Ports from 1024 to 49151 are registered ports, often used by applications or protocols that are not as widely known but still have specific assignments. Ports from 49152 to 65535 are dynamic or private ports, which can be used by applications dynamically or temporarily as needed.

When data is sent from one device to another over a network, it includes both the IP address of the destination device and the port number on that device. This combination allows the network stack on the receiving device to deliver the data to the appropriate application or process.

> For example, when you access a website using your web browser, your computer connects to the web server's IP address (e.g., 192.0.2.1) on a specific port, typically port 80 for HTTP. The server's web server software listens for incoming connections on that port, receives the HTTP request from your browser, and responds with the requested web page data.

Ports enable multiple network services to coexist on the same device by using different port numbers for each service. They provide a way for applications to communicate and share data over a network by ensuring that the right data reaches the right application based on the port number used.



> In the context of socket programming, both the "end" and "close" events represent different events related to the lifecycle of a socket connection. Here's the difference between these two events:

"> end" Event:

- The "end" event is emitted by a socket when the other end of the connection sends a FIN packet, indicating that it wants to close the connection.
It signifies that the peer has finished sending data, and the socket can no longer be used for sending data.
When this event is emitted, the socket is still open for receiving data from the other end, and you can continue reading data from it until the connection is fully closed.
Typically, you would perform any necessary cleanup or respond to the termination of the connection in the "end" event handler.
"close" Event:

- The "close" event is emitted by a socket when the socket is fully closed and is no longer available for any operations.
It signifies that both ends of the connection have finished the close process and the socket resources are released.
After the "close" event is emitted, the socket is no longer usable, and any attempt to read from or write to the socket will result in an error.
You can use the "close" event to perform cleanup tasks, release any associated resources, or take appropriate actions when the socket is fully closed.
In summary, the "end" event is emitted when the other end of the connection indicates the desire to close the connection, while the "close" event is emitted when the socket is fully closed and can no longer be used for any operations.
